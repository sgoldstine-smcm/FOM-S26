		<li>
			<p>
				For each of the following statements, rewrite them either in the form <q>if <m>P</m> then <m>Q</m></q> or in the form <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m></q> without changing their meaning.
			</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						A function is differentiable only if it is continuous.
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						A function is rational if it is a polynomial.
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						For matrix <m>A</m> to be invertible, it is necessary and sufficient that <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>.
					</p>
				</li>

						Whenever people agree with me I feel I must be wrong. (Oscar Wilde)

		<li>
			<p>
				Recall that the <term>converse</term> of <m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> is <m>Q\Rightarrow P</m>. Here are some questions about statements and their converses. When you are asked to explain your answer, give the clearest explanation you can, but don’t worry about writing an official proof.
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider the statement <q>If <m>a\in {\bf R}</m>, then <m>a\in {\bf Q}</m>.</q> Is this statement true? Explain why or why not.
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the converse of the previous statement? Is the converse true? Explain why or why not.
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider the statement <q>If <m>x\neq 0</m>, then there exists <m>y\in{\bf R}</m> such that <m>xy = 1</m>.</q> Is this statement true? Explain why or why not.
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the converse of the previous statement? Is the converse true? Explain why or why not.
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Decide whether or not the following statements are logically equivalent. You may use a truth table, or you may use the rules and definitions from Chapter 2, whichever seems more appropriate for each part, but be sure to clearly justify your answer.
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>(P\lor Q)\land R</m> and <m>P\lor (Q\land R)</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>P\Rightarrow Q</m> and <m>(\sim P)\lor Q</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\sim P</m> and <m>P\Rightarrow(Q\land(\sim Q))</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		
			<p>
				(more on next page) 
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Write each of the following as a sentence in English. Determine whether the statement is true or false, and explain your answer. As in the second question, you do not need to write up formal proofs for these explanations.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				<em>Remark.</em> You may retain non-logic symbols like <m>\geq</m> and <m>=</m>, but try to avoid <m>\in</m>. For this exercise, <q>there exists a real number <m>x</m></q> is preferable to “there exists <m>x\in{\bf R}</m>.
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\forall x\in{\bf R}, \exists n\in{\bf Z}^+, x^n\geq 0</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\exists n\in{\bf Z}^+, \forall X\in{\cal P}({\bf Z}), |X| &lt; n</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						For this part, let <m>P</m> be the set of all prime numbers.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						<m>\forall m\in{\bf Z}^+, \exists p\in P, p&gt;m</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Prove that if <m>x</m> is an odd integer, then <m>x^3</m> is odd.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				<em>Remark.</em> This time, please write a formal direct proof, as in Chapter 4.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Suppose <m>a,b,c\in{\bf Z}</m>. Prove that if <m>a|b</m> and <m>a|c</m>, then <m>a|(b+c)</m>.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				<em>Remark.</em> See previous remark.
			</p>
		</li>

            <shortdescription>An XKCD cartoon and two Sidney Harris cartoons.  The XKCD
				cartoon is titled An Engineer Syllogism, and shows a person at a desk 
				looking at a computer and thinking.
				The thought bubbles say, 1: I am good at understanding numbers.  2: The stock
				market is made of numbers.  3: Therefore, I -- Wow, where did all my money go?
				One Harris cartoon shows a dog thinking: All cats have four legs.
				I have four legs.  Therefore I am a cat.  The other cartoon shows a
				cat thinking: All cats have 4 legs and fur.  I have four legs and fur...
				It's too hard to think anymore.
