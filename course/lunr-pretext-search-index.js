You can use interval notation or general set notation, whichever you prefer.    Give the set by listing its elements between set braces.

For the purposes of this question, the math wing is having an open house on Thursday and Friday.

Rewrite each of the following using only the symbols , , , , , , , and without changing its meaning.       Kiko is coming to both days of the open house.    Kiko is coming to at most one day of the open house. (Equivalently, Kiko is coming to no more than one day of the open house.)

When you explain your decisions about which statements are true and which are false, don’t worry about rigorously proving them. We’ll have the tools to do that in a couple of weeks.    "
